 Using with Maven Invoker with distribution management

 When you want to test the distribution of artifacts as well, we'll have to add a second execution block. 
 The first execution block is used for the repositories (read), the second is used for distribution management (write)

<project>
  ...
  <build>
    ...
    <plugins>
      ...
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-invoker-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>2.0.0</version>
        <executions>
          <execution>
            <goals>
              <goal>install</goal>
              <goal>integration-test</goal>
              <goal>verify</goal>
            </goals>
          </execution>
        </executions>
        <configuration>
          <filterProperties>
            <mrm.distribution.url>\${mrm.distribution.url}</mrm.distribution.url>
          </filterProperties>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId>
        <artifactId>mrm-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
        <executions>
          <execution>
            <id>distribution</id>
            <goals>
              <goal>start</goal>
              <goal>stop</goal>
            </goals>
	        <configuration>
	          <propertyName>mrm.distribution.url</propertyName>
	          <repositories>
	            <hostedRepo>
	              <target>target/hosted-repo</target>
	            </hostedRepo>
	          </repositories>
	        </configuration>
          </execution>
        </executions>
      </plugin>
      ...
    </plugins>
    ...
  </build>
  ...
</project>

 Next you need to ensure per <<<pom.xml>>> that the value of <<<mrm.distribution.url>>> is used for the distribution management.

---
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<project>
  ...
  <distributionManagement>
    <repository>
      <id>mrm</id>
      <url>\${mrm.distribution.url}</url>
    </repository>
    <snapshotRepository>
      <id>mrm</id>
      <url>\${mrm.distribution.url}</url>
    </snapshotRepository>
  </distributionManagement>
  ...
</project>
---

 If you want to split the snapshotRepository from the (release) repository, you have to add an extra execution-block with a different propertyName.

 Since you've defined <<<target/hosted-repo>>> as the upload directory, you can use the postbuild-script from the maven-invoker-plugin to verify if all artifacts were uploaded as expected.
